            Wizardry is a comical psuedonym given to a class of thought surrounding the Supernatural as a science that humans dont have a understanding over yet. there are several groups of wizardry, which can be accessed as seperate pages on the navbar above. note that, while psychobiology and psychoaugmentation are closely related fields, they use different techniques and have seperate focuses. psychoaugmentation is focused on combat skill and strength with narrow scope in other things, while psychobiology has a wider focus on altered biological and psychological states, which gives a wide range of possibility. Syntronics is an application of Wizardry specialized in the utilizatiion of psionic principles, such as energy work, done within a framework similair to psychobiology. the reason its a different category is it has different techniques and some variation in potential use cases.

            Important things to know about Wizardry:
            <menu>
                <li>Wizardry paradigms follow science and its laws, theorems etc. things like the conservation of mass, conservation of energy and fundamental physics stuff is important to research when relevant.</li>
                <li>Wizardry is all about experimentation. you need to be able to figure out how things work, how to interact with them and etcetera. the body is a very complex organism, with plenty of systems within it. Wizards have to be able to interact with, fix and modify these systems easily.</li>
                <li>Wizardry isnt always safe. psychobiology and psychoaugmentation both require modification of the body or mind to enable higher level things, which comes with risks. things like cancerous cells and permanently fucking up your brain chemistry are possible.</li>
