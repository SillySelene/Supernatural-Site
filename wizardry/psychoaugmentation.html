                PsychoAugmentation's main focus is on augmenting the body through the use of the mind. its fundamental basic is to disrupt the bodies natural cycles and systems- this is known as the "Order". the concept of Order is similair to homeostasis in that it represents the natural flow of the body, but the key difference is that the "Order" also represents your current strength, speed etc. its the current baseline, essentially.</p>

                The body functions through systems. the nervous system, the digestive system, etc. all of these follow the order. if you can learn to disrupt the order- modify it, you can modify these systems. you can enhance your senses, your muscles, your body as a whole. this is what psychoaugmentation means- your using your brain to disrupt the order of your body, and can through that modify- or augment, it's systems. through mental effort- or willpower/focus, you can bring forward change.
